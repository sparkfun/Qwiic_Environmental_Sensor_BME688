The SparkFun Environmental Sensor - BME688 (Qwiic) is a breakout board that combines a gas scanning sensor with temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure sensing for a complete environmental sensor in a single package. The gas sensor on the BME688 can detect a wide variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), and other gases such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the part per billion (ppb) range. Combine that with precise temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure and the BME688 can work as a completely standalone environmental sensor all in a 1in. x 1in. breakout!

The sensor communicates via either I2C or SPI. We've broken out the I2C pins to our Qwiic system so no soldering is required to connect it to the rest of your system but if you would prefer, both the I2C and SPI pins are also broken out to standard 0.1in.-spaced pins.

**Note:** While this sensor can be used with the BME AI-Studio and BSEC2 Arduino library; it is recommended for the AI functionality, users purchase the BME688 Evaluation Board (Coming Soon) for ease of use.

<p><div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Important:</b> In order to avoid contamination of its gas scanning capabilities, DO NOT touch the metallic casing of the BME688 sensor. Please, handle with care.</div></p>

_The SparkFun [Qwiic connect system](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) is an ecosystem of I2C sensors, actuators, shields and cables that make prototyping faster and less prone to error. All Qwiic-enabled boards use a common 1mm pitch, 4-pin JST connector. This reduces the amount of required PCB space, and polarized connections mean you canâ€™t hook it up wrong._
